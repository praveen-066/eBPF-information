how the eBPF is working inside the system
1. eBPF programs..(Events attachment)
* it means the eBPF is not run all the  time
* because they are attached with the specific kernal like system calls, file access , and network packet
* when ever the event is happean the eBPF program is triggered autometicly..
2. BPF verification (very important)
*before the eBPF program is allowed to run it checked by a BPF varifier
the verifer is ensuers that the program is safe and there is no crash to system..\
3. JIT compiler (just in time compailer),,,
after varification the program is optimized by the JIT compailer 
this makes the eBPF program is exstreamly fast and efficent
4 . what happens finaly..?
once the verification and complied , the eBPF program runs evenever  the attached kernal event occours, it give the real time insights into system behavior
