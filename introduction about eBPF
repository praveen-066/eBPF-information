eBPF  is a new tecnology and eBPF stands for (extended Berkely packet filter)
Which is modren linux tecnology used for security, monitoring performance and observability.
eBPF is linux feature that allows the small program ot run safly inside the linux kernal
eBPF helps to observe the what the system is doing inernally, in real time...
Why eBPF is needed..?
"modren system uses the containers, microservices and cloude platform like kubernetes.
traditional monitoring tools run in ures space and min=ss low level details"
So eBPS solves this problem by running in directly inside the kernal without modifyinf the kernal or application code ...
why the eBPF is running in kernal is powerfull?
becouse the kernal is control everthing like process, files, network , and memory system so since eBPF run in kernal , it get the accurate and real time information !
"this makes the eBPFmfaster and reliable than the traditonal tools"
